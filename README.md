## Summary
Helloooo! I am Alyx/A1yx (This is my online surname. ), I love to do everything tech! I work at a Dairy Queen at my current time of writing this and take classes at SICTC! I usually show my online persona as a robotic version of a species of dragon called a nardoragon. 

Hobbies

My night time routine includes:

1. Shower or go to work.
2. Sit and eat with my mother if not at work.
3. Come home and shower if from work.
4. Get on computer and do various personal projects. (Ex: Yesterday I helped my mother clean, went out with her and my aunt to eat, then shopped for a bit, came home, and worked on Unity for a bit before getting on VRC. )
5. Do some VR games or Rhythm games maybe.
6. Go to sleep.
